# Nosh Now: A Food Delivery System

This repository is dedicated to my Final Year Project (FYP), "Nosh Now," a comprehensive food delivery system. The system includes three separate applications:

- **Main App**: For buyers and sellers
- **Rider App**: For delivery personnel
- **Admin App**: For administrative control

The project is developed using Dart and Flutter, with Firebase handling the backend database.
